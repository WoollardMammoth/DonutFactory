Have you every wanted a specific wallpaper for your phone or computer, and you could see it so vividly in your head, but no image you could find was just quite right? That is where this began. 

I started in Python, since that is a language I am comfortable workin in. 
After my first version created exactly what I saw in my head, I wanted this to be in a form factor that other people could use. So I decided I should port it over to a web application, and host it with GitHub pages. 

I have never written a web application before, so I used this as a little learning project to see how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS work together. I used Gemini to help me break down my existing Python version into micro-tasks, and coach me through porting it over.
